//! Platform-specific extensions to `std` for Unix platforms.
//!
//! Provides access to platform-level information on Unix platforms, and
//! exposes Unix-specific functions that would otherwise be inappropriate as
//! part of the core `std` library.
//!
//! It exposes more ways to deal with platform-specific strings ([`OsStr`],
//! [`OsString`]), allows to set permissions more granularly, extract low-level
//! file descriptors from files and sockets, and has platform-specific helpers
//! for spawning processes.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::fs::File;
//! use std::os::unix::prelude::*;
//!
//! fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
//!     let f = File::create("foo.txt")?;
//!     let fd = f.as_raw_fd();
//!
//!     // use fd with native unix bindings
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! [`OsStr`]: crate::ffi::OsStr
//! [`OsString`]: crate::ffi::OsString
